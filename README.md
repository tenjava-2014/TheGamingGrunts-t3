About this Plugin
-----

This plugin features 4 different random events:
1. When a Creeper is killed, there is a chance that more can spawn randomly around the player, similar to how zombies work
2. Hailstorms! Out of nowhere, blocks of packed ice will start falling from the sky!
3. Like entities riding on your head? Well, every so often a random mob will be set as your passenger!
4. Like rain? Like mobs? Put both of them together and watch the magic unfold :)

There are also commands to trigger each of the events manually (except Creeper spawning):

1. /mm <passenger | hailstorm | downpour>
