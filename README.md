About this Plugin
-----

This plugin features 4 different random events:
- When a Creeper is killed, there is a chance that more can spawn randomly around the player, similar to how zombies work


- Hailstorms! Out of nowhere, blocks of packed ice will start falling from the sky!


- Like entities riding on your head? Well, every so often a random mob will be set as your passenger!


- Like rain? Like mobs? Put both of them together and watch the magic unfold :)

There are also commands to trigger each of the events manually (except Creeper spawning):

1. /mm
